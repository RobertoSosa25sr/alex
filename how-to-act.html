  <p class="text-justify">Facing a natural disaster can be a frightening experience, but preparation and proper action can make the difference between life and death. The first step in dealing with an emergency is planning. Before any disaster strikes, it is essential to have an evacuation and family meeting plan, identify safe shelters and know escape routes. In addition, it is to have emergency supplies, such as water, non-perishable food, flashlight, first aid kit, and important documents.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">During a disaster, remaining calm is critical. Confusion and panic can increase the risk of injury. Listen to warnings and follow instructions from local authorities. If evacuation is required, doing so in an orderly and swift manner can save lives.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">Solidarity also plays a crucial role. Helping vulnerable neighbors, sharing resources, and collaborating with emergency services strengthen the resilience of the community as a whole. After the disaster, the priority is to assess damage and safety before returning home. Participating in cleanup and rebuilding activities, and offering support to those in need, helps overall recovery.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">In conclusion, preparedness, calm, solidarity, and collaboration are fundamental to act effectively in an emergency, especially in natural disasters. Anticipation and coordinated action not only save lives but also strengthen people's unity in the face of unforeseen adversity.</p>
