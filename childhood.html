  <p class="text-justify">Personally, my childhood was full of challenges and adventures, which came with the company of my family and friends, where I was able to learn many sports such as swimming, soccer, and some extreme sports. This way, I became very curious to learn more every day.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">My name is Alexander Rivadeneira, and I am currently 24 years old, finishing my university studies. I live in Riobamba, one of the coldest places in my country. In other words, my life began on June 9, 1999, in the city of Latacunga, where I lived until I was 4 years old, and I spent a lot of time with my grandparents. At the age of 4, I entered school, where I learned to write and made many friends, but I had to move to live in Macas, where I stayed permanently.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">I was always particularly interested in sports. At the age of 8, I started playing soccer, where I stood out and became part of the soccer team of my province. I also played in important tournaments, but I decided to train in swimming basically because I really like the water and how I can perform. As a result of my passion for swimming, I became a national champion. I also started practicing extreme sports such as skydiving because my father is a great expert in these disciplines.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">In conclusion, I can say that my childhood was very rewarding and fun, where I learned a lot, especially to follow my convictions and do everything I like, always carrying with me the desire to take on the world and still being hungry for more.</p>
